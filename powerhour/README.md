# Power Hour

## What

Power hour app using Spotify.

## Why

- No Spotify-based power hour app exists.
- In the browser because people don't want to download an app

## How

ClojureScript React application using Spotify's Web API.

## Notes

Since it is in the browser the app itself cannot directly play music. It can only be a remote to another instance of Spotify.

## Develop

```sh
yarn install
```

Using Cider run `M-x cider-jack-in-cljs` or `C-c C-x j s`
