# codenames-trio

## What

Three player cooperative key cards for Codenames.

## What this is not

This is not a full Codenames implementation. It is just the key card. You are expected to have the actual game and use the physical target cards.

## How

Vanilla JavaScript.

Hard coded the base template. Shuffle the rows. Each row represents a card.

## Run locally

```sh
npm install -g nodemon http-server
nodemon -x http-server
```

## Deploy

Push to master

## To Do

- Prevent non digits from being entered into the seed text field (very unimportant)
