# codenames-trio

Three player cooperative maps for Codenames

## How it works

Hard coded the base template. Shuffle the rows. Each row represents a card.

## Run locally

```sh
npm install -g nodemon http-server
nodemon -x http-server
```

## Deploy

Push to master

## To Do

- Prevent non digits from being entered into the seed text field (very unimportant)
