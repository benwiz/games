# power-hour

A controller to run a power hour using Spotify.

## Thoughts about React

All my functions ended up in in my top level component (App), why can they not live in the component they actually work with and pass the data upward to App to update the state?

## Version 1 Plan

### How to use

1. Start music on Spotify like normal (possibly within desired playlist)
2. Click the "start" button. Songs will begin changing every 60 seconds.

## To Do

- Countdown timer, skip song
- Pause spotify / game
- Start spotify / game correctly
- Display timer, song title, and artist
- Play a sound when song switches
