# power-hour

A controller to run a power hour using Spotify.

## Thoughts about React

All my functions ended up in in my top level component (App), why can they not live in the component they actually work with and pass the data upward to App to update the state?

## Version 1 Plan

### How to use

1. Start music on Spotify like normal (possibly within desired playlist)
2. Click the "start" button. Songs will begin changing every 60 seconds.

## To Do

- Skip song
- Pause spotify / game
- Restart spotify / game
- Display track information

- Come up with a clever p5.js animation for the background
- Play a sound when song switches
